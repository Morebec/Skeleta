# Skeleta

Skeleta is a CSS library that aims to simplify the process of creating responsive layouts. It provides a set of pre-built classes and components that can be easily customized to create complex designs that look great on any device.

Skeleta is built using modern CSS practices and prioritizes a content-first approach to layout design. This means that instead of relying primarily on breakpoints for responsive design, Skeleta focuses on creating layouts that prioritize the content and adapt to different screen sizes and devices without sacrificing readability or usability.

With Skeleta, you can quickly and easily create responsive designs that are both functional and visually appealing, without the need for extensive custom CSS or complicated media queries.
