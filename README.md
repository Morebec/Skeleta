# Skeleta

Skeleta is a lightweight CSS library that provides a flexible skeleton for
building modern, responsive layouts. It is based on a content-first layout flow
using modern css properties such as flex and grid as opposed to relying mostly on breakpoints for adaptive design.

Skeleta is built with modern CSS practices and includes a set of pre-built classes and components that allow you to easily create complex layouts that look great on any device.
